Got it! Since you're in Hyderabad, January is wintertime, and the climate is cooler with plenty of fresh, seasonal produce available. Here's a list of seasonal ingredients for this time of year:

- **Vegetables**: Cauliflower, carrots, spinach, radish, beetroot, peas, cabbage, and fenugreek leaves (methi).  
- **Fruits**: Oranges, guavas, pomegranates, papayas, and custard apples.  
- **Legumes**: Fresh green chickpeas (hara chana) and fresh green beans.  

Do you have any cuisine preferences for the dinner party? I can suggest dishes based on these ingredients!
