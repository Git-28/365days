Once you've renamed your GitHub repository to NikhilS, follow these steps to proceed:

1. Clone the Repository
Now that your repository is renamed on GitHub, clone it to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Nikhils-G/NikhilS.git
This will create a new folder called NikhilS in your current directory.

2. Navigate to the Repository Folder
Change to the newly cloned repository directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd NikhilS
3. Track .mp4 Files with Git LFS
If you haven’t already configured Git LFS, track .mp4 files:

bash
Copy
Edit
git lfs track "*.mp4"
This creates or updates the .gitattributes file to handle .mp4 files with LFS.

4. Add the .gitattributes File
Stage the .gitattributes file for commit:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .gitattributes
5. Add the Video File
Add your .mp4 file from the Downloads folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add "C:\Users\Nikhil Sukthe\Downloads\cant.mp4"
6. Commit the Changes
Commit the added files:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Add cant.mp4 using Git LFS"
7. Push Changes to GitHub
Finally, push your changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
Replace main with your branch name if you're working on a different branch.

Summary of Next Steps:
Clone the renamed repository.
Track .mp4 files with Git LFS.
Add and commit your .mp4 file.
Push the changes to GitHub.

The error you're seeing indicates that Git is unable to add the file directly from outside the repository folder. To resolve this, you can either move the file into your repository or use relative paths to refer to the file within the repository folder. Here’s how to proceed:

Option 1: Move the File into the Repository Folder
Move the cant.mp4 file from your Downloads folder to the cloned repository folder (NikhilS).

You can do this manually (using File Explorer) or via the command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
move "C:\Users\Nikhil Sukthe\Downloads\cant.mp4" "C:\Users\Nikhil Sukthe\NikhilS\cant.mp4"
After moving the file, add it to Git:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add cant.mp4
Commit the changes and push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Add cant.mp4 using Git LFS"
git push origin main
Option 2: Use Git Bash/Terminal in the Downloads Folder
Alternatively, you can run Git commands directly from the Downloads folder. This way, Git will be able to track files even outside the repository folder. But this approach is a bit unconventional since it could affect how you manage your Git workflow.

Recommended Approach:
Moving the file into the repository folder is the most common and straightforward solution, as it keeps everything within the context of the repository.
